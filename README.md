This is a MP3 player. In order to run it, you need to clone the project and open it in intelliJ .
This is a project where I have created an MP3 player using JavaFX. This will only work if you have Java 17 or more.

Steps to download the application:

1. Write git clone https://github.com/170156028/mp3player.git on Gitbash. If you don't have Gitbash, download the type compatible with your laptop from Google: [https://git-scm.com/downloads]
2. Go to the root directory of the mp3player.
3. Write this command on gitbash: java -jar build/libs/hellofx-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
4. That's it :)
